# Final Web Project B
Our project lets users click around an extensive menu. 
The user may query between one and two variables and see a graph of the results.

Feature List:
  - Query one variable
  - Query two variables
  - Generate graphs based on different types of categorical or continuous data
  - Extensive menu of variables to compare
  - Graphs display plain-english variable meanings
  - Graphs are generated (or an appropriate error message is thrown) with all queries
  - Homepage explains how to use website

Our Data is called the General Social Survey (GSS) Cumulative Datafile 1972-2016.
The site has no apparent licensing info. The data is freely available to download.

The next feature that we would have implemented was supporting a third control variable in each query.

Note: This code currently does not function unless the user has access to the Carleton perlman server, where the SQL database is stored. However, all parts of the website except the results page will still work (with the correct Flask setup for local hosting), and a large number of graphs that have been generated by the backend can be viewed in the static folder.
